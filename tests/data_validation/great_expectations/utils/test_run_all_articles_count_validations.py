"""
This is a basic generated Great Expectations script that runs a Checkpoint.
Checkpoints are the primary method for validating batches of data in production and triggering any followup actions.
A Checkpoint facilitates running a validation as well as configurable Actions such as updating Data Docs, sending a
notification to team members about validation results, or storing a result in a shared cloud storage.
See also <cyan>https://docs.greatexpectations.io/en/latest/guides/how_to_guides/validation/how_to_create_a_new_checkpoint_using_test_yaml_config.html</cyan> for more information about the Checkpoints and how to configure them in your Great Expectations environment.
Checkpoints can be run directly without this script using the `great_expectations checkpoint run` command.  This script
is provided for those who wish to run Checkpoints in python.
Usage:
- Run this file: `python great_expectations/utils/test_run_all_articles_count_validations.py`
- This can be run manually or via a scheduler such, as cron.
- If your pipeline runner supports python snippets, then you can paste this into your pipeline.
